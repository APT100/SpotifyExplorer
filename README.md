A frontend to Spotify's Metadata API I created in order to learn Ember.js

Description
-----------

This is a little practice project I created in order to teach myself [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com).
It consumes the [Spotify Metadata API](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/web-api/search/) 
and shows a neat web UI based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) to display the results.
