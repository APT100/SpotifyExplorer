===============

A frontend to Spotify's Metadata API I created in order to learn Ember.js

Description
-----------

This is a little practice project I created in order to teach myself [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com).
It consumes the [Spotify Metadata API](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/web-api/search/) 
and shows a neat web UI based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) to display the results. 

Features
--------

So far you can:
 
 * Search for artists/songs
 * Searches are remembered
 * Click on a search to show results
 * Click on a song title to show in Spotify
 * Click on a artist/album to show that artist/album in Spotify

Planned features:

 * Switch between http and spotify URIs (top open directly in app)
 * Sorting results table 
 * Pagination
 * ???

Try it out!
